# codelouproject

***Javascript is included in the form at the bottom of the appointments.html page for validation (and keywords are used within the html tags of the various fields that need validation), and in altius.js (which was ultimately not implemented, and was not "from scratch" anyway).


This project is based off of an Indesign mockup of a website designed for a client of my wife's. My wife, Jessica Suhr, is a graphic designer, but not a web developer. She typically sends the mockups to a web dev. She designed the mockup for this site, and a week later the company was sold. I am unsure how far the web devs actually got on the site, but I believe it was live for about a week.

I used her Indesign mockup and content in the ground-up redesign of the page. This is not the complete mockup as designed by Jessica. Some flourishes were left out, and I have added some content/features. She is a MUCH more competent designer than I am, so don't judge poor design choices on her - the bad design ideas were most likely due to my changes. It is not meant to be a "ready-to-launch" site, rather it serves as a demonstration of some of the skills I've learned over the past several months in the CodeLouisville front end web dev course.

My original incarnation included several additional pages, and artifacts of those pages' links can be found in the html nav portion. I've made extensive use of html and my own css (very little Bootstrap), and some javascript/jquery (see form validation on the "Appointments" page. Additionally, a js script for a hero image slideshow is included but ultimately I decided it wasn't appropriate for the page.
