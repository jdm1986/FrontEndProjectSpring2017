# codelouproject

Naturally, first open index.html, and all the other html files can be accessed from that page.

This project is based off of an Indesign mockup of a website designed for a client of my wife's. My wife, Jessica Suhr, is a graphic designer, but not a web developer. She typically sends the mockups to a web dev. She designed the mockup for this site, and a week later the company was sold. I am unsure how far the web devs actually got on the site, but I believe it was live for about a week.

I used her Indesign mockup and content in the ground-up redesign of the page. This is not the complete mockup as designed by Jessica. Some flourishes were left out, and I have added some content/features. She is a MUCH more competent designer than I am, so don't judge poor design choices on her - the bad design ideas were most likely due to my changes. It is not meant to be a "ready-to-launch" site, rather it serves as a demonstration of some of the skills I've learned over the past several months in the CodeLouisville front end web dev course.
