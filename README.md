# codelouproject

This project is based off of an Indesign mockup of a website for a client of my wife's. My wife, Jessica Suhr, is a graphic designer, 
but not a web developer. She typically designs mockups and sends them out to a developer of the client's choosing. A week after the client 
received the website mockup, the company was sold. I played around with several ideas for my codelou project, but eventually decided I would like to have a preexisting design to replicate. My rationale was that replicating an exact layout would be more of a challenge and therefore allow for more practice with positioning and formatting versus simply adding elements and positioning them to look "good enough".

Due to time constraints, this website is limited. It is a work in progress, and pages/links will be added as time goes on.

There are currently four pages, with four stylesheets...
