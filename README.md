# codelouproject

This project is based off of an Indesign mockup of a website designed for a client of my wife's. My wife, Jessica Suhr, is a graphic designer, but not a web developer. She typically sends the mockups to a web dev. This site was live for about a week, after which the client's company was sold and the site went offline.

I used her Indesign mockup and content in the design of the page. This is not the complete mockup as designed by Jessica. Some flourishes were left out, and I have added some content/features. It is not meant to be a "ready-to-launch" site, rather it serves as a demonstration of some of the skills I've learned over the past several months in the CodeLouisville front end web dev course.

Nearly all of the code/markup is original, but I did borrow some code from more advanced developers (such as the photo slider). Where applicable, I have given credit in this readme file.
