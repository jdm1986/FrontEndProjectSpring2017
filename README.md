# codelouproject

Naturally, first open index.html, and all the other html files can be accessed from that page.

This project is based off of an Indesign mockup of a website designed for a client of my wife's. My wife s a graphic designer, but not a web developer. She typically sends the mockups to a web dev. She designed the mockup for this site, and a week later the client's company was sold. I believe the original site was live for a few days.

I used her Indesign mockup and content in the ground-up redesign of the page. This is not the complete mockup as originally designed. Some flourishes, as well as entire pages, were left out, and I have added some content/features. It is not meant to be a "ready-to-launch" site, rather it serves as a demonstration of some of the skills I've learned over the past several months in the CodeLouisville front end web dev course.
