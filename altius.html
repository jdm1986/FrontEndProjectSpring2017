      <p class="dr-p">Dr. Larisa Shevchuk, Altius Health’s founder, started her career as a registered nurse and found herself frustrated with how the traditional health system is focused on caring for the sick over prevention.  Now she’s on a mission to help as many people as possible take control of their health proactively and live their lives to the fullest.<br><br>

She finally decided to leave nursing and studied for four years to become a chiropractor and is a graduate of the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College.<br><br>
Since becoming a chiropractor, she practiced in multiple clinics and finally went on to found Altius Health as a place to heal patients and help them focus on their holistic health.  Now, Dr. Larisa works with children (including infants), pets, athletes, expectant mothers and anyone else interested in their holistic health.<br><br>
